Computer Graphics


## Programming Assignments: 
- 1: Create a program that draws a picture on a 2D Canvas on a Web page. Your submission must demonstrate the use of lines and polygons, and the use of slider elements for input.
- 2: Make a program with an object (or more) that uses the concept of hierarchical modeling and have it be animated.
- 3: Make a program with an object (or more) that uses the concept of hierarchical modeling and have it be animated, using explicit matrix and vector representations for the points and transforms involved.
- 4: Make a program that uses a parametric curve to define an intricate trajectory, and use this representation both to draw such a curve as well as move/animate an object along it.
- 5: Write a program that visualizes a 3D scene, as viewed from a movable camera, and use 2D Canvas drawing operations to construct a 2D projected view of it on your screen.
- 6: Experiment with the shdr.bkcore.comLinks to an external site. interactive shader editor to create your own pair of vertex & fragment shader, and test it with the provided 3D geometric models
- 7: Use WebGL to create a 3-dimensional scene, with your own shaders, models, and associated data (vertex attributes, colors, normals, textures, etc).
- 8: Use WebGL to create a 3-dimensional scene using textures to enrich the visual appearance of your objects.
