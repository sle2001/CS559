This assignment is to create a program that draws a picture on a 2D Canvas on a Web page. 
Your submission must demonstrate the use of lines and polygons, and the use of slider elements for input.

I decided to create a mouse in a house where the sliders can slide to move the mouse both in the x and y direction.
